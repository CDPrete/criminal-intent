# criminal-intent
CriminalIntent Android App (chapter by chapter with challenges and some improvements) developed on the Big Nerd Ranch Android book (2nd ed.)

Another way to solve this challenge is to change the model (the Crime class) adding another java.util.Date object to store the time.
In this way the management of the code would be simpler (you don't have to worry about the consistency of the dates in the *onActivityResult* method, but you'll use more memory).
