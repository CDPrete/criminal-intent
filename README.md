# criminal-intent
CriminalIntent Android App (chapter by chapter with challenges and some improvements) developed on the Big Nerd Ranch Android book (2nd ed.)

In this chaper I didn't follow the book so much, in fact I preferred to use GreenDAO (an Android ORM for SQLite) to deal with the database (who doesn't use an ORM nowdays?).

Morover, (using the database missing as an excuse) starting from this chapter is possible to set a crime as solved from the CrimeListFragment's view directly.
